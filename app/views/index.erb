<h1>  Project Herbert </h1>
<p> What many people take for granted, primary education as a child, is not somepthing that is provided for free by communities across the world. </p>
<p> Herbert Niwagaba devoted his life to the children in his community. He tragically died in a collision with a truck in April, 2017. This project is in honor of him. </p>
<p> Let's sponsor these kids and support them going to school. </p>
